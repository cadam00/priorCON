Description: An innovative tool-set that incorporates graph community detection
             methods into systematic conservation planning. It is designed to
             enhance spatial prioritization by focusing on the protection of
             areas with high ecological connectivity. Unlike traditional
             approaches that prioritize individual planning units, 'priorCON'
             focuses on clusters of features that exhibit strong ecological
             linkages. The 'priorCON' package is built upon the 'prioritizr'
             package <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.prioritizr>, using commercial
             and open-source exact algorithm solvers that ensure optimal
             solutions to prioritization problems.
