\description{
Solve a \pkg{prioritizr} prioritization problem, by incorporating graph
connectivity of the features.
}
\arguments{
\item{cost_raster}{
\code{SpatRaster} object used as cost for prioritization.
Its coordinates must correspond to the input given at
\link[priorCON]{preprocess_graphs}.
}
\item{features_rasters}{
features \code{SpatRaster} object used for prioritization.
Its coordinates must correspond to the input given at
\link[priorCON]{preprocess_graphs}.
}
\item{budget_perc}{
\code{numeric} value \eqn{[0,1]}. It represents the budget percentage of the
cost to be used for prioritization.
}
\item{pre_graphs}{
output of \link[priorCON]{get_metrics} function.
}
\item{locked_in}{
\code{SpatRaster} object used as locked in constraints, where these planning
units are selected in the solution, e.g. current protected areas. For details,
see \code{prioritizr::add_locked_in_constraints}.
}
\item{locked_out}{
\code{SpatRaster} object used as locked out constraints, where these planning
units are excluded from the solution, e.g. not appropriate for protected areas.
For details, see \code{prioritizr::add_locked_out_constraints}.
}
}

\details{

A connectivity prioritization problem is created and solved using
\pkg{prioritizr} package.
The solver used for solving the problems is the best available on the computer,
following the solver hierarchy of \pkg{prioritizr}. By default, the \pkg{highs}
package using the \href{https://highs.dev}{HiGHS} solver is downloaded during
package installation.

Both features and connectivity rasters are min-max scaled before solving the
prioritization problem.
}

\value{
A list containing input for \link[priorCON]{get_outputs}. Additionally, the
connectivity \code{SpatRaster} objects that are used in prioritization are
returned as well, before and after min-max scaling
(\code{original_connectivity_rast} and \code{normalized_connectivity_rast}
objects correspondingly).
